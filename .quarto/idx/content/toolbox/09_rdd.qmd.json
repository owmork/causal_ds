Fist used in 1960 (Campbell), it did not play a large role until 1999 and since then has experienced growing acceptance due to the advance of more rigorous requirements regarding credibility and causality in social sciences. Another factor that made many researchers use RDDs is the increased availability of digitized administrative data that is often linked to arbitrary rules that can be exploited to capture \"as-if\" randomization processes for treatment assignment.\n\nAssuming a data-generating process, where we have a variable $X$ that is a confounder as it has an impact on treatment assignment $D$ and the outcome $Y$. Additionally, we could have an unobserved confounders between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nThen, as can be seen in the second DAG, the regression discontinuity design exploits the fact that $X$ determines $D$ and data is filtered such that there are only observations that were close to a cut-off value determining their treatment status. This way, treated and untreated units are very similar and comparable and RDD is able to eliminate selection bias for that sub-population. Note that the treatment effect you calculate using this method is an average treatment effect for a subgroup rather than for the whole population. Like with IV, it is the local average treatment effect ($LATE$).\n\n$X$ is called the **running variable** and is a continuous variable assigning units to treatment $D$ based on a cut-off score $c_0$. Because it has an impact on $Y$ as well, it is a confounder and opens a backdoor path. Now, the problem is that due to the cut-off determining the treatment $D$, the backdoor cannot be closed with regular ways like e.g. matching as there is no overlap, i.e. there are no treated and untreated units for all levels of $X$.\n\n::: callout-important\n-   Running/forcing variable: variable that determines or strongly influences treatment assignment.\n\n-   Cut-off/threshold: rule-based value that divides units into treatment an control group.\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n#| echo: false\n#| layout-nrow: 1\n#| fig-cap:\n#|  - \"Relationships when using full sample.\"\n#|  - \"Relationships when restricting sample to units close to cut-off.\"\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggdag)\nlibrary(dagitty)\n\n# Initial situation\ninitial <- dagify(\n  Y ~ D,\n  Y ~ X,\n  Y ~ U,\n  D ~ X,\n  X ~ U,\n  exposure = \"D\", \n  outcome = \"Y\", \n  latent = \"U\",\n  coords = list(x = c(Y = 1, D = 0, X = 0, U = 1),\n                y = c(Y = 0, D = 0, X = 1, U = 1))\n)\n\nggdag_status(initial, text = T) +\n  theme_dag_cds() +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  geom_dag_text(color = \"white\") +\n  geom_dag_edges(edge_color = \"white\")\n\n# RDD\nrdd <- dagify(\n  Y ~ D,\n  Y ~ U,\n  D ~ X, \n  exposure = \"D\", \n  outcome = \"Y\", \n  latent = \"U\",\n  coords = list(x = c(Y = 1, D = 0, X = 0, U = 1),\n                y = c(Y = 0, D = 0, X = 1, U = 1)),\n  labels = list(X = \"X close to c0\", Y = \"\", U = \"\", D = \"\")\n)\n\nggdag_status(rdd, text = T, use_labels = \"label\") +\n  theme_dag_cds() +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  geom_dag_text(color = \"white\") +\n  geom_dag_edges(edge_color = \"white\")\n```\n\nTherefore, as the second graph shows, the causal effect is identified by analyzing only observations that are in close neighborhood to $c_0$. The identified treatment effect is the **local average treatment effect (LATE)**.\n\n$$\nLATE_{RDD} = E[Y_1 - Y_0| X \\rightarrow c_0] \n$$\n\n# Continuity assumption\n\nRDD relies heavily on the continuity assumption, which implies that the **cut-off value is exogenous**, i.e. there is no logic why the cut-off has to be at that particular level of $X$. In other words, the rule was chosen arbitrary. Only if that is fulfilled, **expected potential outcomes are almost the same for units just below and just above the cut-off** (the only units that are analyzed). Across the cut-off threshold, both $E[Y_0|X \\rightarrow c_0]$ and $E[Y_1|X \\rightarrow c_0]$ are **continuous functions** of $X$.\n\nSmooth and continuous functions of potential outcomes at the cut-off also implies that there are **no other interventions or variables** that occur at the cut-off and rules out omitted variable bias.\n\nGraphically, we have illustrated the continuity assumption by removing the arrow from $X$ to $Y$. As all units have about the same value for $X$, no effect from $X$ on $Y$ can be expected from those specific units. For $X \\rightarrow c_0$, there is no direct effect from $X$ to $Y$.\n\nThere are two different designs of RDD. Both have in common that the **probability of treatment changes** **discontinuously** at the threshold, but how strict the probability changes differs.\n\n-   **Sharp design:** at the cut-off, probability changes from 0 to 1. All units below cut-off belong to control group, while all units above cut-off belong to treatment group (or the other way around).\n\n-   **Fuzzy design:** at the cut-off, probability discontinuously increases. Most units below cut-off belong to control group, while most units above cut-off belong to control group (or the other way around). Here, cut-off is used as an instrumental variable.\n\nThe continuity assumption is crucial for conducting a valid RDD and that is why you have to ensure it is fulfilled.\n\n[Violations can potentially happen when]{.underline}:\n\n-   units know assignment rule in advance\n\n-   units are interested in adjusting behavior according to assignment rule\n\n-   units have enough time to adjust\n\n-   other factors cause potential outcomes to shift at cut-off\n\n-   nonrandom heaping along running variable\n\n![Example of nonrandom heaping at a marathon. There are way more individuals who finish just under 4 hours than individuals that finish just above 4 hours. Individuals seem to have a particular interest to finish just before 4 hours.](/images/09_heaping.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"540\"}\n\n# Application\n\n## Identification Strategy\n\nRDDs are quite intuitive and very graphical. For this reason, we will go through estimation and inference using an application and explain at each step what has to be considered.\n\nOur application is as follows: we are interested how sending a coupon to customers incentivizes their purchase behavior. We could run a randomized controlled trial and only send a coupon to a random selection. However, an already conducted campaign can actually be exploited. Last year 5â‚¬ coupons were sent to customers who had not bought within the previous 60 days.\n\nThat is an arbitrary cut-off rule that we have discussed in the introduction. We can exploit it because we have customers around the cut-off that should be very similar. However, we could not convincingly argue that customers that had bought within the last few days are similar to those who have bought for example more than three months before.\n\nThus, our cut-off value is $c0 = 60$.\n\nLet's have a look at what the data looks like. We know when the customers has bought the last time and based on that received a coupon or did not receive anything and we know the purchases he/she made after the coupon distribution.\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\ndf <- readRDS(\"../../datasets/coupon.rds\")\n\n# Define cut-off\nc0 <- 60\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\n# Read data. You probably have to add the correct path\ndf <- readRDS(\"coupon.rds\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Show data\ndf\n```\n\nIllustrating the relationships in a DAG, we can see that for our running variable `days_since_last` being close to the cut-off value, we can estimate a local average treatment effect.\n\n```{r}\n# Running variable does not affect purchases itself as we only\n# estimate a local average treatment effect. Also, there is no non-random\n# heaping at cut-off.\nlibrary(dagitty)\nlibrary(ggdag)\n\n# Directed Acyclic Graph\n# Define\nrdd <- dagify(\n  Y ~ D,\n  Y ~ U,\n  D ~ X,\n  exposure = \"D\",\n  outcome = \"Y\",\n  latent = \"U\",\n  coords = list(x = c(Y = 1, D = 0, X = 0, U = 1),\n                y = c(Y = 0, D = 0, X = 1, U = 1)),\n  labels = list(X = \"Days since last\\naround cut-off value\",\n                Y = \"Purchases after\",\n                U = \"Unobserved\",\n                D = \"Coupon\")\n)\n\n# Plot\nggdag_status(rdd, text = T, use_labels = \"label\") +\n  theme_dag_cds() +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  geom_dag_text(color = \"white\") +\n  geom_dag_edges(edge_color = \"white\")\n```\n\nAt first glance, it looks like all restaurants below the cut-off don't have a \"very good\" label (indicated by FALSE) and the restaurants above cut-off do have it. We can visualize if that applies to all restaurants. As we have expected, to the left of the cut-off and to the right of the cut-off, there is always just one label type. It means, we are dealing with a sharp cut-off.\n\nBecause the coupons were assigned by a computer, we deal with a sharp cut-off. This means every customer with no purchase history within the last 60 days did receive the coupon and every customer with purchases made within this period did not receive it.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: \"Sharp cut-off. All eligible customer were sent an coupon and not eligibles did not receive it.\"\n\n# [2] Visualization ----\n# [2.1] Compliance ----\n# As expected, perfect \"compliance\" and sharp cutoff. All \n# customers below the cutoff get no coupon, while all customers above\n# the cutoff get a coupon.\ncompl <- \n  ggplot(df, aes(x = days_since_last, y = coupon, color = coupon)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c0, color = ggthemr::swatch()[5]) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, position = position_jitter()) +\n  guides(scale = \"none\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = c(\"No coupon\", \"Coupon\"))+\n  scale_color_discrete(labels = c(\"No coupon\", \"Coupon\")) +\n  xlab(\"Days since last purchase\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\ncompl\n```\n\n## Random assignment\n\nAs already mentioned, for RDD to deliver valid results we have to make sure there is no non-random heaping at the cut-off, i.e. no manipulation because for example the effect is known and units attempt to move to one side of the cut-off. We can plot the distribution around the cut-off to check for violations of the continuity assumption.\n\nWe can see that there is no decline or incline at the cut-off and therefore can assume that the continuity assumption holds.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: \"Number of customers for given days since last purchase. As there are many customers who buy regularly and also a number of one-time purchasers, the distribution has such a decreasing curve.\"\n\n# [2.2] Random assignment test ----\n# identifying assumption: random assignment to either side of cut-off\n# Manual plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = days_since_last, fill = coupon)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 4, color = \"white\", boundary = c0, alpha = .6) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c0, color = ggthemr::swatch()[5]) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"No coupon\", \"Coupon\")) +\n  xlab(\"Days since last purchase\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of customers\") +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank())\n```\n\nTo check the continuity assumption more thoroughly, we can also use functions of the `rddensity` package. It relies on a test to check the assumption. as the p-value is large, we can reject the null hypothesis that the number of units at either side are different.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: \"Density tst. If confidence intervals overlap, we can assume continuity.\"\n\n# Density test\n# Check for continuous density along running variable. Manipulations could \n# lead to running variable being \"crowded\" right after cutoff.\nlibrary(rddensity)\nrddd <- rddensity(df$days_since_last, c = c0)\nsummary(rddd)\n```\n\nIt can also be shown graphically, where you can see that the confidence intervals overlap. If they did not overlap, we would have to suspect some kind of manipulation around the cut-off and could not use RDD to get valid results.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n\n# Visually check continuity at running variable\nrdd_plot <- rdplotdensity(rddd, df$days_since_last, plotN = 100)\n```\n\n## Visualization\n\nHaving checked potential violations of the continuity assumptions, we can move on and estimate the treatment effect. We start with selecting a bandwidth, i.e. we select what and how many observations should be compared. The larger the bandwidth, the more observations are taken into consideration but it also reduces the comparability. On the other hand, choosing a small bandwidth results in a lower number of observations while ensuring similarity and comparability.\n\nThere is no safe rule how to best select the bandwidth, although there are algorithms attempting to look for the optimal bandwidth. For now, we just use common sense and select a bandwidth of 5 days, resulting in an analysis window $[55, 65]$, which still leaves us with about 300 observations.\n\n```{r}\n# [3] Dependent variable ----\n# [3.1] Average Treatment Effect ----\n# Plot regression lines for full and specified bandwidth.\n# Specify bandwidth\nbw <- c0 + c(-5, 5)\n\n# Subsets below and above threshold in specified bandwidth\ndf_bw_below <- df %>% filter(days_since_last %>% between(bw[1], c0-1e-4))\ndf_bw_above <- df %>% filter(days_since_last %>% between(c0, bw[2]))\n\n# Alternative way to define tables\n# df_bw_below <- df %>% filter(days_since_last >= bw[1], days_since_last  < c0)\n# df_bw_above <- df %>% filter(days_since_last >= c0, days_since_last <= bw[2])\n\ndf_bw <- bind_rows(df_bw_above, df_bw_below)\ndim(df_bw)\n```\n\nTo illustrate the difference between using only a small window and all data, we plot the resulting regression lines. You can see that both approaches would lead to different results.\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n#| fig-cap: \"Visual comparison of purchases after coupon allocation.\"\n\n# Plot dependent variable vs running variable\ndep_var <-\n  ggplot(df, aes(x = days_since_last, y = purchase_after, color = coupon)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c0, color = ggthemr::swatch()[5]) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.2) +\n  # add lines for the full range\n  geom_smooth(data = filter(df, days_since_last <= c0), \n              method = \"lm\", se = F, linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = filter(df, days_since_last > c0), \n              method = \"lm\", se = F, linewidth = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  # add lines for specified bandwidth\n  geom_smooth(data = df_bw_below, method = \"lm\", se = F, \n              color = ggthemr::swatch()[7], linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_smooth(data = df_bw_above, method = \"lm\", se = F, \n              color = ggthemr::swatch()[7], linewidth = 2) +\n  scale_color_discrete(labels = c(\"No coupon\", \"Coupon\")) +\n  xlab(\"Days since last purchase\") +\n  ylab(\"Purchase after coupon assignment\") +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank())\ndep_var\n```\n\nFrom the plot above, it is hard to see what the difference between observations close to the cut-off is. So what we can do is to compute to regressions, one for the observations in $[55, 60)$ and another one for the observations in $[60, 65]$.\n\nThen, using the resulting coefficients, we compute what both models predict for the cut-off value $c0$ and take the difference. The difference is the local average treatment effect (LATE).\n\n```{r}\n# [3.2] Local Average treatment effect (LATE) ----\n# Extract values for vertical lines to visualize local average treatment effect\nmodel_bw_below <- lm(purchase_after ~ days_since_last, df_bw_below)\nmodel_bw_above <- lm(purchase_after ~ days_since_last, df_bw_above)\n\ny0 <- predict(model_bw_below, tibble(days_since_last = c0))\ny1 <- predict(model_bw_above, tibble(days_since_last = c0))\n\nlate <- y1 - y0\nlate\n```\n\nIt's a bit messy when we plot all observations, so let's zoom in to see if we can detect the local average treatment effect graphically. Not surprisingly, it is equal to what we have just computed.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: \"Treatment effect for customers within +- 5 days.\"\n#| message: false\n\n# Minimum and maximum for y-axis limits\nmin_y <- min(df_bw$purchase_after)\nmax_y <- max(df_bw$purchase_after)\n\n# Add lines for vertical distance and change limits of x-axis.\ndep_var_bw <- \n  ggplot(df_bw, aes(x = days_since_last, y = purchase_after, color = coupon)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c0, color = ggthemr::swatch()[5], size = 2) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(data = df_bw_below, method = \"lm\", se = F, linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_smooth(data = df_bw_above, method = \"lm\", se = F, linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = c0, xend = bw[2], y = y0, yend = y0),\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = ggthemr::swatch()[4]) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = bw[1], xend = c0, y = y1, yend = y1),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = ggthemr::swatch()[4]) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = c0+2, y = mean(c(y1, y0)-2),\n           label = sprintf(\"Difference: %.2f\", (y1 - y0)),\n           color = ggthemr::swatch()[4], fontface = 2) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min_y, max_y)) + \n  scale_color_discrete(labels = c(\"No coupon\", \"Coupon\")) +\n  xlab(\"Days since last purchase\") +\n  ylab(\"Purchase after coupon assignment\") +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank())\ndep_var_bw\n```\n\n## Estimation\n\nWhat you will see most in studies is a regression to compute the LATE. Here, we prefer to use `days_since_last_centered`, which is the raw `days_since_last` variable centered, i.e. subtracted by the cut-off value $c0$. That simplifies the interpretation, however, it does not change the coefficient of interest, the LATE.\n\nThe coefficient we are most interested in is the one for `couponTRUE`. It is equal to the effect in the plot above, but the regression summary also yields additional statistical information. We see that the LATE is statistically significant.\n\n```{r}\n# [4] Estimation ----\n# [4.1] Parametric ----\n# Compute coefficients for specified bandwidth.\nlm_bw <- lm(purchase_after ~ days_since_last_centered + coupon, df_bw)\nsummary(lm_bw)\n```\n\n# Assignment\n\nFor the first assignment, use the data from the just discussed application (`coupon.rds`). When conducting a regression discontinuity design, one parameter that is chosen somehow arbitrarily is the bandwidth. Check how sensitive the result is to changing the bandwidth by running the analysis\n\n1.  with half the bandwidth\n2.  with double the bandwidth\n\nNow consider a different past campaign. For a limited amount of time, for purchases with a total amount of more than 30â‚¬ you offered free shipping. The data can be seen in `shipping.rds`. Have a look at the variable `purchase_amount` and argue whether it could generally be used as a running variable with a cut-off at 30â‚¬.\n\n3.  Use a plot to confirm your argument.\n\n::: callout-warning\n## How to submit your solutions!\n\nPlease see [here](https://owmork.github.io/causal_ds/submission/submission.html) how you have to successfully submit your solutions.
